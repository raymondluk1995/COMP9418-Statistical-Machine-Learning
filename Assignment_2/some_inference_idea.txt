1.  Particle filtering 
* Setup the transition probabilty for people moving from 1 room to the other 
* Trace the movement, update with the evidence, and resample 
* base on the Most probable movement made decision 
* 3D hidden markov network 

2. 34 separate netowrks.
* check the max step staff can move 
* construct hidden markov network for each room (max steps, evidence and also last period) 
* inference one by one;
* maybe for some y, linear regression/ decision is more accurate than this one.
